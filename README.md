### Video Libarary 
This video platform integrates the YouTube API and includes viewer registration, login, and video comment options. All users can view comments, only regsitered and logged in users can comment.


## Development
The scaffolding was generated using Django and Django REST Framework and is connected to a MySQL RDS.
 
## CI/CD
I am using github workflows to push changes to the `main` branch as needed. 

## Project Status
This project is feature complete but not currently hosted and includes the following features:  
- Users account registration, login and logout 
- Logged in users can add comments to videos other users can view comments made 
- Users can search for videos using the search bar
- Users immediately see related videos when they select a video for viewing 

Other features I hope to add: 
- Option to reply to comments
- "likes" for videos, video comments, and comment replies

Thanks taking the time to check out my project ðŸ˜Š.
